# AHT-Counter
While I was working at Etisalat for Global Services EGS as a call center advisor, (Chat non-voice team) we had a certain Average Handling Time (AHT) required for each chat not to exceed, but unfortunately there was no meaningful way of measuring that on our own (we had to wait untill it is emailed to us), so I created this tool in my spare time to help me keep track of the AHT during the shift - I did most of the coding in a notepad since we were working on a virtual machine No IDE or other programs or websites allowed - 

I also created an index with all the webpages of the information center of the company packages and offers and information pages in order to spare my lazy self the search for those pages, each and every new page we learned in the training I copied its link and name and placed them in one notepad file in the following form:
Page name - Link, Page name - link ... etc
Then I found an online python interpreter website that wasn't blocked and then had python seperate the lines and add the Html tags for me in a loop and then print it out
1. seperate each line on the commas to get pairs of key (page name) and value (link).
2. included both the key and value in the <a> tag both the name and link with the target being "blank" and then copied them all to the .htm file 
3. utilized css to seperate them by category (Mobile prepaid / requests / postpaid, etc..)

Unfortunately I currently do not have access to the files since I forgot to copy them before I leave the job
